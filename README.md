# power-automate-etl-orchestration
A collection of Power Automate workflows used to orchestrate ETL pipelines, automate data ingestion, and trigger downstream processing in modern data architectures.

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of **Power Automate workflows** designed to support **ETL orchestration, data ingestion, and process automation** within a modern data platform architecture.

Power Automate is used as a **low-code orchestration layer**, enabling event-driven triggers, validation steps, and integration between business-facing tools (such as SharePoint, Outlook, and Forms) and downstream data processing platforms.
